# 🚀 Agentic AI Learning Path  

Agents and **Agentic AI** are reshaping the future of technology by enabling autonomous systems that can reason, plan, and execute tasks with minimal human input.  
This repository contains my hands-on journey through building **multi-agent systems, agentic RAG applications, and custom AI tools** using leading frameworks such as **CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, and PydanticAI**.

## 📚 About This Learning Path  

Agentic AI represents a significant step forward in AI by combining **reasoning + action** to solve complex, multi-step problems and adapt dynamically to real-world scenarios.  

This repo is structured as a **project-based curriculum**, where each project introduces a new concept or framework while reinforcing previously learned principles.  

🔑 **Core Skills Gained**:  
- Multi-agent coordination & collaboration  
- Workflow orchestration & reasoning patterns  
- LLM tool integration & function calling  
- Schema-driven & adaptive AI agents  
- Practical applications across **healthcare, customer support, content analysis, and document processing**
