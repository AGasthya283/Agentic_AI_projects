# 🚀 Agentic AI 

Agents and **Agentic AI** are reshaping the future of technology by enabling autonomous systems that can reason, plan, and execute tasks with minimal human input.  
This repository contains my hands-on journey through building **multi-agent systems, agentic RAG applications, and custom AI tools** using leading frameworks such as **CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, and PydanticAI**.
